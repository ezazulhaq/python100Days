Task

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Average = (Sum of Distinct Heights) / (Number of Distinct Heights)
"""

def average(array):
    # your code goes here
    return sum(set(array))/len(set(array))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
